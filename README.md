# DarkSoulsQueryServer
 
ASP.NET server that provides an API for clients to query the world state of the current running Dark Souls III process. Depends on [DarkSoulsMemoryReader](https://github.com/srogee/DarkSoulsMemoryReader), so clone that first! Currently used by [DarkSoulsQueryClient](https://github.com/srogee/DarkSoulsQueryClient).
